The goal of the VTEUs is to initiate innovative concepts for clinical research and implement clinical site protocols for evaluating vaccines, other preventive biologics, therapeutics, diagnostics, and devices for the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases, and CVD is uniquely poised to accomplish this goal. CVD's expert and accomplished investigative team has complementary skill sets in all areas necessary to address the NIAID priority areas, with established management plans to effectively allocate work and conduct multiple projects simultaneously. CVD is internationally recognized for our capacity and capability to conduct controlled human infection trials for malaria, influenza, and enteric pathogens and to implement treatment and prevention trials in endemic areas for malaria and neglected tropical diseases (NTD), both of which have been a focus of its research for many years. CVD has access to U.S. populations of healthy subjects in all age groups for this research and subjects with special risks, such as patients attending outpatient clinics with sexually transmitted infection (STI) and other conditions that generally do not requiring hospitalization. Strong domestic collaborations at sites experienced in clinical trials provide the CVD's VTEU with surge capacity among healthy subjects of all ages and vulnerable populations such as pregnant women in the U.S. to address public health emergencies. CVD's international collaborators, including two long-standing permanent field sites in Africa, are an invaluable resource for vetted international trial sites in low resource countries endemic for malaria and NTD with experience in conducting high quality NIAID and VTEU studies. This proposal describes mechanisms to implement protocols that arise from concepts proposed by the Leadership Group (LG) and the research community including investigators from other VTEUs, academia, industry, non-governmental organizations, and DMID. These concepts will focus on NIAID priority areas, including malaria, NTD, respiratory infections, particularly influenza, enteric diseases, STI, and emerging infectious diseases and other infectious disease considerations. Under our VTEU contract that is nearing completion (2013-2023), CVD was awarded over 23 Task Orders, enrolled over 1,500 participants, and successfully collaborated with national and international sites. This renewal application is intended to supplement the new VTEU award (1UM1AI148689) that we received in December, 2019 in response to AI18-046; funding for this award was limited to one year as a result of an omission by our Sponsored Programs Administration to include a request for 7 full years of funding.

grant,"$127,165","$414,425",NA,"PROJECT SUMMARY In this emergency R21 effort we propose to implement a set of novel studies designed to improve our fundamental understanding of SARS-CoV-2 aerobiology. Through a combination of theoretical, experimental, and epidemiological data, there is emerging consensus that respiratory aerosols play a primary role in the transmission of COVID-19. However, despite the importance of understanding the fundamental mechanisms involved in the airborne transmission route, a number of basic questions central to SARS-CoV-2 aerobiology remain unanswered. In particular, the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 particles within different aerosol size populations has not yet been studied in detail, nor is there data available to predict the viability and infectivity of individual airborne virus particles within different aerosol populations. Furthermore, it is not currently known whether the virus tends to be uniformly distributed within a given aerosol population or clustered within a small number of aerosol droplets, an essential question for understanding the quantum of infection for COVID-19 transmission. To address these challenges, we propose a novel analytical approach combining efficient sampling of exhaled breath, high resolution fractionation of aerosol ensembles, and coupled analysis of inactive and infective virus particles within the collected aerosol fractions through a combination of RT-PCR and viral plaque assays. Significantly, aerosol fractionation will be performed using an Aerodynamic Aerosol Classifier as a unique technology for isolating monodisperse aerosol populations. In addition, a new technique for discretizing the collected aerosol particles will be implemented using a thermo-responsive hydrogel for aerosol deposition, allowing the particles to be delivered to cell culture while remaining spatially isolated and elucidating virus distribution and clustering within a given size fraction. The combined data sets resulting from the proposed studies will provide a first view of the distribution and conformation of SARS-CoV-2 within respiratory aerosols, and the relationships between aerosol properties (size, virus content, virus distribution, and clustering) and downstream infectivity. We anticipate that the improved understanding of aerosolized virus infectivity emerging from these studies will illuminate fundamental aspects of COVID-19 airborne transmission and allow us to identify the quantum of infection associated with SARS-CoV-2, thus supporting accurate modeling of transmission dynamics and guiding improved recommendations for PPE, room ventilation, and sanitation protocols to enhance intervention and minimize transmission of the virus.","DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

project summary in this emergency r21 effort we propose to implement a set of novel studies designed to improve our fundamental understanding of sars-cov-2 aerobiology. through a combination of theoretical, experimental, and epidemiological data, there is emerging consensus that respiratory aerosols play a primary role in the transmission of covid-19. however, despite the importance of understanding the fundamental mechanisms involved in the airborne transmission route, a number of basic questions central to sars-cov-2 aerobiology remain unanswered. in particular, the distribution of sars-cov-2 particles within different aerosol size populations has not yet been studied in detail, nor is there data available to predict the viability and infectivity of individual airborne virus particles within different aerosol populations. furthermore, it is not currently known whether the virus tends to be uniformly distributed within a given aerosol population or clustered within a small number of aerosol droplets, an essential question for understanding the quantum of infection for covid-19 transmission. to address these challenges, we propose a novel analytical approach combining efficient sampling of exhaled breath, high resolution fractionation of aerosol ensembles, and coupled analysis of inactive and infective virus particles within the collected aerosol fractions through a combination of rt-pcr and viral plaque assays. significantly, aerosol fractionation will be performed using an aerodynamic aerosol classifier as a unique technology for isolating monodisperse aerosol populations. in addition, a new technique for discretizing the collected aerosol particles will be implemented using a thermo-responsive hydrogel for aerosol deposition, allowing the particles to be delivered to cell culture while remaining spatially isolated and elucidating virus distribution and clustering within a given size fraction. the combined data sets resulting from the proposed studies will provide a first view of the distribution and conformation of sars-cov-2 within respiratory aerosols, and the relationships between aerosol properties (size, virus content, virus distribution, and clustering) and downstream infectivity. we anticipate that the improved understanding of aerosolized virus infectivity emerging from these studies will illuminate fundamental aspects of covid-19 airborne transmission and allow us to identify the quantum of infection associated with sars-cov-2, thus supporting accurate modeling of transmission dynamics and guiding improved recommendations for ppe, room ventilation, and sanitation protocols to enhance intervention and minimize transmission of the virus."
